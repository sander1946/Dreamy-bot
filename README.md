    tech_oracle_role_id: int = <role_ID> # can create an private Dev channel if needed
    event_luminary_role_id: int = <role_ID> # here so they can create teams
    
    allowed_roles: list[int] = [<sancturary_keeper_role_id>, <sky_guardians_role_id>, ...] # these are the rols that are allowed to create teams and sutch
